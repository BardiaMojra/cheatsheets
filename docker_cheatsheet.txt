# show images
docker images 

# run a container 
docker run -it [container]

# 3 steps
# If you donâ€™t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix 
# group called docker and add users to it. When the docker daemon starts, it 
# makes the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the docker group.
# Add the docker group if it doesn't already exist:
sudo groupadd docker # 1
# Add the connected user "$USER" to the docker group. Change the user name to 
# match your preferred user if you do not want to use your current user:
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker # 2
# Either do a newgrp docker or log out/in to activate the changes to groups.
# You can use
docker run hello-world # 3
